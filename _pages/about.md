# Welcome to my personal website!

I’m currently a Ph.D. student in Cybersecurity, with a deep passion for exploring how things work, especially in the digital world. My journey in this fascinating field began in April 2024, when I had the opportunity to work as a Research Fellow for the SmartShire Project, which opened doors to new ideas and challenges that fueled my passion for research and innovation.

As someone who’s always been curious, I’ve developed a keen interest in several areas, including:

*Web Security*: Ensuring the safety and integrity of online spaces.  

*Binary Analysis*: Unpacking and understanding the underlying structures of code.  

*Simulation*: Creating models to replicate and study complex systems and scenarios. 

*Capture the Flag (CTF)*: competitions: Though I’m still honing my skills and learning the ropes, I enjoy the thrill of solving puzzles and challenges related to cybersecurity.

Through this website, I’ll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and projects as I navigate the world of cybersecurity research.
